This repository was written in 2017-2018. It examines the relationship between health and wealth using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. It contributes to three interrelated projects, all of which examine how the health wealth relationship is mediated by one's race, asset allocation, and socio-economic strata with longitudinal modeling approaches (e.g. fixed effects models, mixed effects/growth models).
